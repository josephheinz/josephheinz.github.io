            I used to think that I wanted to be mega rich, mansion, travelling
            the world, zoo in my backyard, 8 kids. How was I going to do this? I
            was going to hustle, business, investment properties, trading,
            stocks, etc etc. But, looking back on it, I was just kind of
            brainwashed by the Red Pill manosphere. Now I realize that this was
            just a want injected into my head by people who didn't want the best
            from me.

          <h1>What do I want</h1>
          <p>
            Now I've gotten to thinking, and at this point, right now, I don't
            want to me a multi-millionare, I mean sure that would be nice, maybe
            a buyproduct of what I'm doing in life, but all I really want is to
            have a family, a house, ideally a farm with a few acres- nothing
            insane, just like 5-10. I want to basically leave society. I know
            that's not possible, but I want to get as close as I can. If I was
            the type of person who could be by myself for the rest of my life, I
            think this would be a lot easier. I would turn into a Chris
            McCandless or someone of the like, right. Just go become a
            philosopher in the woods. I'd probably go insane though. Maybe not,
            I feel lonely all the time right now, but maybe that's because
            there's people all around me, but I feel like I'm on this island.
            Maybe if I lived in a hut in the woods, I wouldn't have anyone to be
            alone from, if that makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe you're wondering, did I get blue-pilled, libtarded, aspergers
            from my fall from red pill grace? Not exactly, I still think I'm on
            the right side of the political spectrum, but I think I'd less
            retarded now, I'm open to different opinions, but that could just be
            growing up. I know I'll look back at me writing this down in a few
            years and be thinking the same thing about my current self. But
            that's just growing up, I think my shift from the red pill to the
            black pill for a short time, now in a state of something like the
            white pill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok hold up, writing that down makes myself cringe and makes me feel
            like I have chronic brainrot, but it sounded better in my head. I
            can't really think of a better way to put down my thoughts than
            that.

          <h1>The issue with modern society</h1>
          <p>
            "It's the liberals, the libs, we need to own the libs" It's not, at
            least I don't think it is, it's the issues with the corporations and
            hidden agendas of people that don't even reveal themselves. Here's
            the issue I have with that is that I basically can't have even a
            fair chance at the life I want to live. You just gotta roll with the
            punches I guess. Yes, life would've been better if I was born as a
            boomer, but I can't undo my birth. I just need to do my best with
            what I was given. Maybe this upcoming difficulty in my transition
            into adulthood will lead to a better, more fulfilling life.
