          <span
            >As described by wikipedia breakdancing is "a style of street dance
            originated by African Americans in the Bronx". Now it's in the
            Olympics and its called 'breaking'. I think its a joke and shouldn't
            have been added.

          <h1>The Beef</h1>
          <span
            >My opinion on breakdancing being added to the Olympics is a little
            more nuanced than just, 'its so stupid that they added breakdancing
            to the olympics'. It seems silly that the Olympics have added
            breakdancing because it seems to me, an outsider looking in, someone
            who has never breakdanced or been in a place where breakdancing was
            prominent, that breakdancing is less of a sport and more of an art
            form. Maybe I'm completely wrong, and people who know and partake in
            breakdancing can understand why it is being added to the Olympics as
            a sport. But it seems to me that judging a breakdancing performance
            is the same as judging someone on a painting they just painted. Its
            not such a static or concrete thing to measure.<br /><br />I do
            think that it takes skill to become proficient at breakdancing, so
            maybe there is merit to it being added to the Olympics, since you
            could be able to measure the skill of a particular breakdancer off
            of a rubric, perhaps with individual moves strung together as is in
            gymnastics. However, some people just suck at this stuff. Check out
            this Australian breaker, breakdancer? Person who is breaking

            To me, this just looks like someone who doesn't know what to do or
            how to properly control their body while performing, and is honestly
            what I would expect to see myself do the first time I would try
            breakdancing, and like, how are the judges supposed to score this?
            She flails her arms around, touches her toes, does a backwards
            somersault, and spins on the ground while also touching her toes,
            again. Alright, maybe since I'm not a part of the breakdancing
            community I don't understand the skill and control it takes to pull
            off a routine like I just mentioned. But, really the Olympics are
            supposed to be impressive to the <b>world</b>. Its kinda the point,
            the best of the best from countries all around the world competing
            to see who's the best in the world right now. You know what would
            have impressed me more than some random flailing and body movements?
            <br /><br />Backflips, spinning on one arm, headspins, maneuvering
            on just your arms.<br /><br />Granted, this is currently the only
            clip I have viewed of Olympic Breaking as of now, so maybe the
            Aussie's performance is just lackluster compared to other
            countries'?<br /><br />That's pretty much all of my thoughts right
            now, just saw this clip on Reddit and it reminded me of the collapse
            of civilization in the West.
